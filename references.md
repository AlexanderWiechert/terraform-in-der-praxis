List of people who work with Terraform very actively and can tell you a lot \(if you ask them\) - [https://twitter.com/antonbabenko/lists/terraform-experts](https://twitter.com/antonbabenko/lists/terraform-experts)

There are a lot of Terraform experts who are writing blog posts about Terraform, advices, best practices, open-source projects and other things closely related to the topics described in this book, and I can't think of what can be the best structure to get these links listed here \(please leave your feedback\).
